Installing CentOS for D-Star
############################

Basic OS install
****************

The actual install of the basic OS is pretty simple, and the user is guided
through a series of questions that should be easy enough to figure out. Screen
shots of the process are included in `another article <../Appendix/CentOS_VM.html>`_,
generated by installing the ISO in a VirtualBox virtual machine.

Version 5.11 of CentOS is sightly different from the version used in the Icom_
installation guide, but the basic steps are the same. I followed the Icom_ guide
to get a basic install configured. There were a few things I did differently
for convenience.

Network Configuration
=====================

The Icom_ guide has you set up the server for the final placement in the
repeater site. The guide requires specific IP addresses that are not normally
available in my home environment. As discussed earlier, I configured my home
network so the server lives in the same network environment it will see at the
repeater site.

Details on this setup are available in `D-Star Network Setup <NetworkSetup.html>`_

Adding Users
============

During the install, you are offered a chance to set up a normal user account on
the server. I added a user who will serve as administrator. Once the system was
running, I added this user to the ``sudo`` user list. Instructions for doing
this are in another article.

Later we will add other users to serve as system
administrators, and give then `sudo` access as well.

Software Setup
==============

The Icom_ guide works through the installation of the Firewall, DNS Name Server
and development tools. The development tools were  installed by default in
version 5.11, so that step was skipped. A detailed installation article is
provided elsewhere on this site.

Icom Software Installation
**************************

With the basic server running, the Icom_ gateway software installation script
can be run.
