    "*D-Star* repeaters in central Texas. I am new to *D-Star*, but have a lot ofexperience in software design, and I have taught Computer Science at the college level. I thought my experience with *Linux* systems would let me contribute to the *D-Star* community in the area, and that could help me get my equipment running as well. So, I volunteered to help rebuild two servers that were falling into disrepair. \n",

Icom has chosen to keep this software closed source, and the setup requires very specific versions of operating system and other components. I am not happy about this, since many of these requirements are very old, and may soon be unsupported. In order to keep *D-Star* a viable system for Amateur Radio users, this has to change. \n",
