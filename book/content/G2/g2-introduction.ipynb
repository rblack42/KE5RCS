    "*D-Star* repeaters in central Texas. I am new to *D-Star*, but have a lot ofexperience in software design, and I have taught Computer Science at the college level. I thought my experience with *Linux* systems would let me contribute to the *D-Star* community in the area, and that could help me get my equipment running as well. So, I volunteered to help rebuild two servers that were falling into disrepair. \n",
