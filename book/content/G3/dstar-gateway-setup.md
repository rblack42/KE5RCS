# D-Star Gateway Setup

This note details the setup of the KE5RCS D-Star gateway server. We will work
through the setup and identify system requirements and procedures for
confirming those requirements are met and the system is fully functional. 

Basically, two documents were used in this setup:

- [RS-R3PC_1.pdf](assets/files/RS_R3PC_1.pdf)
- [G2toG3UpgradeInstructions.pdf](assets/files/G2toG3UpgradeInstructions.pdf)

The basic guide to setting up a gateway server for a D-Star repeater in the
ICOM guide: [RS-R3PC_1.pdf](assets/files/RS_R3PC_1.pdf). The G2 to G3 upgrade
guide was written by Brian Rhodes () who wrote the installation script use din
this setup.
