    "We put off doing the G3 upgrade to the KE5RCS repeater for far too long. What pushed us over the edge was a hardware failure that took out our RP2C controller unit. When we looked into repairing the device, we discovered that ICOM has basically abandoned these controllers and moved on to new repeater hardware. After considering options, we elected to buy a single ID-RP4010V repeater module and retire the full stack of repeaters we still have at the repeater site. Those may be surplussed at a later time.\n",
